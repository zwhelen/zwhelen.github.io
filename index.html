            <p>I am a Senior Lecturer in Spatial Planning. Prior to this, I was a Lecturer and a Leverhulme Early Career Fellow at the University of Manchester.</p>
            
            <p>The first strand of my research centres on examining spatial inequalities, including their underlying determinants and socio-economic and environmental impacts, to inform and support spatial planning policies. My ongoing projects investigate spatial health inequalities and their relationships with socio-economic and environmental factors.</p>

            <p>Another strand of my research focuses on spatial structure, human mobility, their interactions, and sustainability implications. I employ a multi-scalar spatial perspective and mixed methods to analyse these issues, aiming to understand spatial planning challenges and identifying potential policy interventions and solutions. </p>
            
            <p>I have extensive research experience in spatial planning, having led or contributed to research projects funded by institutions such as the Economic and Social Research Council, the Leverhulme Trust, the British Academy, the National Institute for Health and Care Research, and the Alan Turing Institute. </p>

            <p>Currently I am the Co-Associate Director of Research Ethics and Co-Chair of the Ethics Committee in the School of Environment, Education, and Development.</p>
