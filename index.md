# About

I am a Senior Lecturer in Spatial Planning. Prior to this, I was a Lecturer and a Leverhulme Early Career Fellow at the University of Manchester.

The first strand of my research centres on examining spatial inequalities, including their underlying determinants and socio-economic and environmental impacts, to inform and support spatial planning policies. My ongoing projects investigate spatial health inequalities and their relationships with socio-economic and environmental factors. Another strand of my research focuses on spatial structure, human mobility, their interactions, and sustainability implications. I employ a multi-scalar spatial perspective and mixed methods to analyse these issues, aiming to understand spatial planning challenges and identifying potential policy interventions and solutions.

Currently I am the Co-Associate Director of Research Ethics in the School of Environment, Education, and Development.
